COVID-19 DATA VISUALIZATION IN POWER BI.

Purpose:- To analyze and visualize COVID-19 case and death trends across countries and WHO regions.        

Step:- 
       - Data Preparation and ensure dataset contains i.e. Date, WHO region, country, Covid Cases, Death and so on.
       - Import data into Power BI.
       - Create new cloumn of weeks in year and Month Name.
       - Created Line and Clustered Chart for the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths evolved over time in different regions.
       - Created Line Chart for patterns or trends in the data, such as spikes or declines in cases.
       - Again created a line Chart to plot weekly moving average of the cases and deaths using week cloumns as I had created before.
       - Using Pre defined Bar chart I have shown country wise count.
       - I have used pre defined Map Chart Map Chart to visualize the intensity of covid cases.
       - Create a hierarchy of WHO region and Country Using Tree Map.
       - Using hierarchy using treemap visualization identified which WHO regions are most affected.

       
 Dashboard Creation:-
       I have created Dashboard with only 5 visualization and created monthly filter Using Month column as I had extracted Month name from Date column
